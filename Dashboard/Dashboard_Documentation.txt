# Power BI Dashboard Implementation Guide

## 1. Core DAX Measures

To ensure accurate reporting, the following DAX measures were implemented:

Total Customers: `Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Customer_Churn_Master[CustomerID])`
Total Revenue: `Total Revenue = SUM(Customer_Churn_Master[Monetary])`
Average Recency: `Avg Recency = AVERAGE(Customer_Churn_Master[Recency])`
Churn Rate %:

## 2. Visualizations & Setup

### A. Executive KPI Header

Visual Type**: Multi-row card or individual Card visuals.
Purpose : Provides an immediate "pulse check" of the business scale and the severity of customer attrition.

### B. RFM Segment Distribution (TreeMap)

Group: `Segment` (calculated based on R, F, and M scores).
Values : `Total Customers`.
Design Strategy : Applied a diverging color scale—Deep Green for "Champions" and Warning Red for "At Risk" segments.
Insight : Simplifies complex behavioral data into high-level business categories.

### C. Churn Behavior Analysis (Scatter Plot)

X-Axis : `Recency`.
-Axis : `Frequency`.
Legend : `Is_Churned`.
Insight : Visualizes the "Danger Zone"—the specific point in time (e.g., 60-90 days) where purchase frequency drops and churn probability spikes.

### D. Geographic Revenue & Churn Map

Location: `Country`.
Bubble Size: `Total Revenue`.
Color Saturation : `Churn Rate %`.
Insight : Identifies if churn is  localized to specific regions, allowing for targeted geographic marketing interventions.

## 3. Business Logic & Recommendations

The dashboard is designed to support the following strategic actions:

Proactive Retention : Customers entering the "At Risk" segment (high recency) should trigger automated re-engagement workflows.
Value Protection : High-monetary customers show lower churn rates; loyalty programs should focus on maintaining this "Champion" core.
Win-back Strategy : Using the "Hibernating" segment to identify past high-value shoppers for specialized win-back offers.
